The objective of this project is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using data analysis and machine learning techniques to minimize financial losses and enhance transaction security.

Data Collection & Understanding
The dataset contains transaction details such as transaction amount, time, location, and anonymized customer features, along with a fraud label.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data analysis is performed to understand transaction patterns, class imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, and key variables influencing fraud.

Data Preprocessing

Missing values and inconsistent records are handled.

Feature scaling is applied to normalize transaction amounts.

Highly imbalanced data is addressed using techniques such as undersampling, oversampling (SMOTE), or class weighting.

Feature Selection & Engineering
Important features contributing to fraud detection are selected, and new features are engineered to improve model performance.

Model Development
Machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting are trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix, focusing on minimizing false negatives.

Fraud Prediction & Monitoring
The best-performing model is used to predict fraudulent transactions in real time or batch mode and supports continuous monitoring.

Conclusion
The project helps identify suspicious transactions effectively and improves fraud prevention strategies for financial institutions.
